### Kingdom Hearts Re:Collection is a free archive of art assets and custom fonts created by Televo.

Re:Collection contains over 700 unique icons and a handful of fonts inspired from across the KH series, including worlds, combat abilities, key items, progression events, wallpapers and more. Icons can be classified into two artistic styles: DETAILED flashy artwork and MINIMAL coloured symbols.

This archive is known for being featured in the majority of KH Trackers, Randomizers and in numerous modded projects throughout the community.

If you decide to use these assets and fonts publicly, giving credit is much appreciated although not necessary. No doubt my time spent here exceeds 2000 hours so if you cherish what I do with all your heart, consider supporting me. Of those who have already done so, I am tremendously thankful.

Feel free to contact me anytime via Email or Discord. And I hope my efforts here help you to create something magnificent.

Font characters in Re:Collection are recreated faithfully, directly from the games whenever possible (such as KHTitle which pulls its characters from The World That Never Was). They have improved letter spacing (specifically when setting spacing to metric, not optical) and support various languages including English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Turkish, Polish, Norwegian, Swedish, Russian, Portuguese, Danish, Indonesian and other latin-based languages.

Letters and numbers in KHScala are accurate to our current knowledge, but may contain translation inaccuracies due to the Scalan language having not been fully deciphered. Punctuation contains some repeat characters, additional symbols and custom made characters.
