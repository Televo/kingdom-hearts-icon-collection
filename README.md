# Kingdom Hearts Icon Collection

The Kingdom Hearts Icon Collection is an archive of art assets and fonts created by Televo to be used freely by all members of the community. If you decide use the assets publicly, dropping a line of credit would be much appricated but not nessecary. Even so, message me on Discord at Televo#9400, as I love to see how my efforts have helped.

[Download the Collection Here](https://github.com/Televo/kingdom-hearts-icon-collection/releases/download/v2.0/kingdom-hearts-icon-collection.zip) or go to the Releases page and click on the latest kingdom-hearts-icon-collection.zip file.
